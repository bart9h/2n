## How to play

Use `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` or vi arrow keys (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to play.

`n` resets the board.

`q` quits.

Game is automatically saved/loaded in `~/.2nrc`

Set environment variable `SIZE` to change the board size
(effective on next board init), must be between 3 and 16.
Example: `SIZE=8 ./2n`
